# This is the test assignment of Sypto

## 1st Assignment for Data science

### 1. Are you interested to work in crypto?


Yes, I am Interested to work in crypto, as crypto are going to change our financial
system in future. Many countries have already adopted the rules to govern crypto
market. It will replace the traditional banking system and bridge two currencies to
facilitate faster, more affordable cross-border transactions around the world.

### 2.Can you prepare a basic price analysis on any coin of your choice?

### 3. What is the ATR of any particular coin of your choice for the last 1 year?

The ATR of HBAR for last 1 year is 0.0068.

### 4. How would you explain std-deviation to a child?

Think about the snowy mountains, most of the snow is on the peak of the mountain
and when you descend down there is less snow and finally at the creek there is
almost no snow(all snow is melted to water).
Normally everything in the world follow the similar patterns and so we call it std. If
we pictorially represent our day to day data it will give similar picture of a mountain
or a bell, it indicates most quantity is at the peak, just like the snow on the top of
mountain and std deviation indicates how far snow fell on the mountain from each
other. We can say it is the spread of snowfall(data points) from the top of
mountain(mean).

### 5. Do you think std-deviation makes sense as a tool for analysis?

Yes, standard deviation is important for analysis, it indicates the distribution is
normal distribution or not. We have 3 sigma(68–95–99.7) for our data and if our data
falls between this category it is eligible for forecasting, prediction, modelling and
result.
In a Gaussian distribution mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1. We generally
normalize the feature if it is not following the normal distribution. So our goal as a
analyst is to ensure all the numeric column follow this 3 sigma rule.

### 6. What is your tool-kit to analyse any kind of data?

I use several tool-kit to analyse the data depending upon the types of variable.
### EDA:

#### - For categorical variable :

I use countplots, barplots and frequency tables.

#### - For geographical data:

I use maps in Tableau.

Countplots.

Pivot tables in Microsoft excel

#### - For numerical variables

    For correlation: Scatterplot

    For outlier detection: boxplot

    For distribution: kde plot.

    For time series data: line chart

    For data cleaning : python pandas, numpy.

    For machine learning: scikit learn, Xgboost.

    For Visualization: mostly tableau and matplotlib.
